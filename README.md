# personal-website
My personal website I created using Flask with Bootstrap, and deployed to www.anthonyedrake.com using Heroku.

# motivation
I wanted to be able to have job recruiters find my website when they type my name in Google. In addition, I thought it would be a nice project to do as I never truly had experience in building a website from scratch and deploying it to the cloud. 

## what's next?

- replace stock image with a carousel of photos I have taken
- spruce up the GUI, perhaps a nice background or something
